```html
<article class="article-featured">
  <h2 class="article-title">Finding simplicity in life</h2>
  <img
    src="img/life.jpg"
    alt="simple white desk on a white wall with a plant on the far right side"
    class="article-image"
  />
  <p class="article-info">July 23, 2019 | 3 comments</p>
  <p class="article-body">
    <strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it doesn't
    have to be! There are many ways to simplify your life,
    <a href="#">a few of which we've explored in the past</a>. This week we're
    taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the
    life you already living.

<article class="article-recent">
  <div class="article-recent-main">
    <h2 class="article-title">How to keep your cooking simple</h2>
    <p class="article-body">
      Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be
      healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to
      keep your cooking nice and simple.

```css
.subtitle {
  font-weight: 700;
  color: #1792d2;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  margin: 0;
}

.article-title {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

.article-read-more,
.article-info {
  font-size: 0.875rem;
}

.article-read-more {
  color: #1792d2;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 700;
}

.article-read-more:hover,
.article-read-more:focus {
  color: #143774;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

.article-info {
  margin: 2em 0;
}
```

### Continued development

This project opened my mind to the term "Thinking Responsive". This mindset affects the whole project from the HTML CSS code in general, how my divs, section etc tags are structured to adding CSS media queries, the kind of CSS units used (%,em,rem,vh) and so on.
I really love this project :)

### Useful resources

- [CSS Units](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-units-explained) - The concepts of CSS Unit was a struggle until I found this article.
- [Article tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_article.asp) - This helped me learn about the article tags which is a semantic HTML tag
